Powershell script to restore inherited permissions for all lists in a site collection.

 

Before you run it, you have to modify the last line of the script!

 

 

```PowerShell
# Paths to SDK. Please verify location on your computer. 
Add-Type -Path "c:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\15\ISAPI\Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll"  
Add-Type -Path "c:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\15\ISAPI\Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll"  
 
 
 
Set-SPOListResetRoleInheritance -Username "trial@trialtrial123.onmicrosoft.com" -Url "https://trialtrial123.sharepoint.com" -AdminPassword "Pass" -IncludeSubsites $true
``` 

Enter your credentials and the site where you want to modify the inheritance.
Set -IncludeSubsites $true  if you want to restore inherited permissions also in the subsites 
Set -IncludeSubsites $false if you want to restore inherited permissions only in the main/root site  
Verify if the SharePoint Online SDK is installed in the same location on your computer
