# AllGalleryScriptsSamples

Over 200 SharePoint Online scripts 
* fixing issues
* generating reports 
* extra settings not available via UI
* bulk updates
* provide automation script samples to address IT Pros' frequently asked IT tasks.

The scripts use Powershell, C#, CSOM and REST. They include copies of existing scripts from Technet Gallery years 2013-2019 - the transfer is in progress and the documentation/description is still taking shape.

Most of them were tested and verified by hundreds and thousands of users of [Technet Gallery, where you can still find them](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/site/search?f%5B0%5D.Type=User&f%5B0%5D.Value=Arleta%20Wanat) 

You can find here script samples to:
* enable, modify and change versioning settings, version numbers
* set, modify and remove permissions
* manage permission inheritance on list / folder or item level
* get, set and report on content types
* fix issues connected with content type removal, and bulk-remove them
* modify and manipulate your item display forms
* manage your files - move, copy across libraries and tenants, create reports on and generate randomized samples
* copy structures across libraries, sites and tenants
* move item attachments to another library
* modify various list and library settings, e.g. reading order
* check in and check out items, including bulk check in of checked out files
* create columns, views, fix issues related to deleted/missing views
* remove, modify fields
* create OneDrive for Business storage reports
* change time zones
* get and delete page web parts
* manipulate sites, subsites and their properties
* report on and restore selected/all recycle bin items
* set themes and get reports on workflows
* There are also custom modules, for files/items or columns management cmdlets with tens of examples on how to use them available on [Technet Wiki](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/32334.sharepoint-online-spomod-resources.aspx) 


Their new home at GitHub is still relatively recent, so if you find any issues, please do let me know. I appreciate every comment and every feedback.
